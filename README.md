  ## Description

  A react + typescript application that allows an user to accept or reject candidates pulled from Github.

  ## Installation
  
 Download the zip from GitHub. Open the command line and use npm install and npm run dev in the command line.  

  ## Usage
  
  After running npm run dev, a local server should launch the application. An random user pulled from Github API will appear. The user can either accept or reject the user. Regardless of which option choosen, the page will load another candidate. If the candidate was accepted, they will appear on the Potential Candidate page. On said page, you can either reject a single candidate or all of them with the button at the bottom of the page.
